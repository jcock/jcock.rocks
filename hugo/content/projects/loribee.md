## Overview
After starting a healthy pet supply chain, called IB Pet, in 2009, Lori set her eyes on developing a line of natural products for both pets and people. LoriBee was a company born of a desire to create quality products without the use of harsh toxins.

## Strategy
The idea behind the brand was to match the line. Smooth, clean lines, rounded corners, and thin lettering, help present a softer feel. Color choices were based off of the essential oils prevalent in all of the products. The bee was the finishing touch. Not only is it a visual representation of the name, LoriBee, but it helps to add a little bit of quirkiness and fun. Two values that are essential to the company.
